Con Gen
=========
version 0.0.1

Con-Gen (Conlang Generator) is a Conlang (Constructed Language) word generator created as a way to quickly generate words in syllabic pattern of a specified Conlang. It primarily created as a way to learn Python and create a utility for personal use in the development of the Actarian Conlang.

At the moment it only generates words for the Actarian language, but I intend to add language support for other conlangs as well as a web interface and export options for easy on the fly generation.

The app.py and console.py are currently very bare bones and are mainly used for testing.

A goal is to build a REST API that a third party application on the server can use to interact with the app.
